## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. **Patient_Mortality_Prediction**
This folder contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict patient mortality within 180 days of their last medical exam.

#### Highlights:
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted demographic, condition, and medication features.
- **Models:** Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
- **Evaluation:** Achieved AUC-ROC of 0.683 using Logistic Regression.

#### Key Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook for the pipeline
- Presentation and final report
- External dataset link (Google Drive)
