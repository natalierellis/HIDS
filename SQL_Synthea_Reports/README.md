# SQL Reports

This folder contains SQL reports created as part of my Health Informatics and Data Science (HIDS) program. All analyses are based on the **SyntheticMGUH dataset**, a synthetic database provided by the program to simulate real-world healthcare data. These reports showcase my ability to query and analyze complex datasets using SQL, highlighting both technical and analytical skills.

## Reports

### [Report 1: De-identification of Patient Data](https://natalierellis.github.io/HIDS-Portfolio/SQL_Synthea_Reports/Deidentified_patient_registry.html)
This report demonstrates the process of de-identifying patient data to comply with HIPAA standards. It includes creating a fully de-identified dataset, a limited data set, and ensuring equivalence across all versions. The work focuses on securely handling sensitive data while preserving its utility for analysis.

### [Report 2: Quality of Care of Asthma Patients](https://natalierellis.github.io/HIDS-Portfolio/SQL_Synthea_Reports/QI_asthmatics.html)
This report evaluates the quality of care provided to asthma patients based on clinical guidelines. It includes analyses of patient demographics, medication adherence, care plans, and vaccination rates. The findings highlight critical areas for improvement in asthma management.

### [Report 3: Multi-Stakeholder COVID Patient Registry Proposal](https://natalierellis.github.io/HIDS-Portfolio/SQL_Synthea_Reports/multi-stakeholder-covid-patient-registry.html)
This proposal outlines the creation of a collaborative COVID-19 patient registry across three hospitals in Washington, DC. It details patient selection criteria, data standardization strategies, and key outcomes to track. SQL queries are used to generate the registry and explore patient data.

### [Report 4: Insurance Claims Metrics](https://natalierellis.github.io/HIDS-Portfolio/SQL_Synthea_Reports/synthetic_mguh_metrics.html)
This report analyzes healthcare spending patterns using insurance claims data. It includes breakdowns of spending by payer type (Medicare, Medicaid, and others) and explores patient insurance status over time. The analysis highlights trends in healthcare expenditure and coverage.
