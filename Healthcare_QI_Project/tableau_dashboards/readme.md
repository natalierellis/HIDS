# Tableau Dashboard Demonstration

This section highlights the dashboards created for our project, showcasing key metrics and results from our intervention. Below, you will find two GIFs illustrating the interactive features of the dashboards, along with explanations of their significance.

### Key Insights:
- **Patient Demographics of Intervention Cohort**:
  - Our cohort represents a diverse patient population with race categories equally represented, ensuring broad applicability of our intervention's success.
  - Approximately 75% of patients are male, helping us understand the demographics where the intervention had the most impact.
  - Most patients are in the 30-50 and 50+ age groups, aligning with hypertension risk factors.

- **Baseline Metrics**:
  - At baseline, 93.2% of referrals were inappropriate, indicating the need for to more effectively manage hypertension patients by PCPs. 
  - Our OpenEMR intervention reduced inappropriate referrals by PCPs from **93.2% at baseline** to **30% during the intervention period**, reducing unnecessary clinic overload.

- **Goal Achievement**:
  - Our target was to achieve **≤60% inappropriate referrals**. Achieving 30% surpasses this goal, demonstrating the intervention's effectiveness.

## GIF 2: Provider Adherence and Challenges

### Key Insights:
1. **Provider Adherence**:
   - Adherence measures how well providers followed management steps (e.g., Hypertension Management Forms, medication prescriptions) before referral.
   - Target adherence was **≥70%**, and most providers met or exceeded this threshold. 

2. **Analyzing Provider Performance**:
   - Dr. Aey did not meet the adherence goal, highlighted in orange for attention.
   - Using additional visualizations, we explored the correlation between patient volume and provider adherence.

3. **Challenges and Observations**:
   - Higher patient loads, such as Dr. Aey's, may impact adherence rates.
   - A scatterplot indicates a potential negative relationship between patient volume and adherence, although not statistically significant due to the small sample size.

4. **Funnel Chart**:
   - Highlights key management steps completed before referral:
     - **Hypertension Management Forms**: 80% completion.
     - **Antihypertensive Medications**: 80% completion.
     - **Lifestyle Modifications Care Plans**: 50% completion (significant gap).
   - Improving Lifestyle Modifications Care Plan completion is crucial for appropriate patient management.

## Next Steps
- **Resource Allocation**: Provide additional resources or workflow adjustments for providers managing higher patient volumes.
- **Training Initiatives**: Focus on improving Lifestyle Modifications Care Plan adherence through training and support.
- **Data Monitoring**: Continue gathering data to monitor trends and validate findings with a larger sample size.
